## Generations

- **First Generation (2002-2013)**: Introduced initially in Europe as a compact panel van, the first-generation Transit Connect was built on Ford's C170 platform. It featured a front-wheel-drive layout and was powered by various engines including a 2.0L gasoline engine and several diesel options. The vehicle was notable for its high roof design and sliding side doors, making it ideal for commercial use. In 2009, it received a facelift that included updated styling and interior improvements.

- **Second Generation (2013-2023)**: Built on Ford's Global C platform, the second generation brought significant modernization to the Transit Connect. It offered both short and long wheelbase variants and was available in passenger and cargo configurations. Engine options included a 2.5L inline-four and a more efficient 1.6L EcoBoost engine, later updated to include a 2.0L direct-injection four-cylinder. This generation featured improved safety features, better fuel economy, and more refined driving dynamics.

- **Third Generation (2024-present)**: The latest generation Transit Connect is based on Volkswagen's Caddy platform as part of a Ford-VW commercial vehicle partnership. It features modern driver assistance systems, improved connectivity options, and more efficient powertrains including electrified options. The new generation maintains the vehicle's practical nature while offering enhanced comfort and technology features.
